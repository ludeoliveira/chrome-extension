 This is a Chrome Extension built as an exercise to the Scrimba's Learn JavaScript For Free course. 
 This extension helps the user to keep track of the people online who might take interest in their product by saving a list of url's that they can visit later. One can save profiles of potential clients by copying the url to the input field in the extension or saving the active tab instead.
